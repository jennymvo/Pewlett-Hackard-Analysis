# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to use SQL databases to sort out information for determining the number of retiring employees per title and identify those who are eligible to participate in the mentorship program.

## Results
- Most of the retiring employees are on the senior level. 
- There are 72,458 people who are retiring soon   
- There are 1,549 people who are eligible for the mentorship program 
- Only 2% of the retiring employees are eligible for the mentorship program 

## Summary

In summary, there are not enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees. With only about 1% of retiring employees eligible for the program, each mentor is going to need to take on at minimum 47 new hires to fill in the positions. 

Alarmingly, the youngest employees in company is 57 years old. At full normal retirement age of 67, that does not allow for much time to find replacements to keep the employee numbers in the company.

When checking the percentage of employees from each age range, it can be seen that over a quarter of the employees are already at or over the retirement age.
